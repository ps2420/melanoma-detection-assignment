# Deep Learning - Melanoma Detectoin Assignment
> Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. Repository contains a deep learning cnn model that can predict if skin cancer is Melanoma.

## Business Objective
To build a CNN based model which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

The solution analyses a repository which contains various images belonging to following diseases and analyses a dataset. 

- Actinic keratosis
- Basal cell carcinoma
- Dermatofibroma
- Melanoma
- Nevus
- Pigmented benign keratosis
- Seborrheic keratosis
- Squamous cell carcinoma
- Vascular lesion

## General Information
- Repository contains the jypter notebook and some useful insights about the deep learning cnn model that alerts dermatologists about Melanoma which accounts for 75% in skin cancer disease.
- The solution analyses a dataset which contain images belonging to various diseases.

## Conclusions
 

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.2.1, Tensor flow, Keras deep learning cnn module and google col-lab
- Thr project was developed on google coloab as it requires GPU to train deep learning model
